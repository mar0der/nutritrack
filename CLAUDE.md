## 🔧 Latest Session Updates - Database Seeding & Frontend Connectivity (July 5, 2025)

### 🎯 Issues Addressed
1. **Empty Database in Production**: Frontend showing no data despite successful deployment
2. **API Connectivity Problems**: Frontend unable to connect to production API
3. **Environment Variable Configuration**: Vite build-time vs runtime environment issues
4. **Database Authentication**: Prisma client authentication failures after container restarts

### 🛠️ Technical Solutions Implemented

#### Database Seeding Strategy Improvements
- **Problem**: Database seeding was clearing all data on every deployment
- **Solution**: Implemented smart seeding that preserves existing data
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `backend/scripts/seed-database.ts` - Added data existence check
  - `backend/scripts/reset-database.ts` - New script for manual reset
  - `backend/package.json` - Added `seed:reset` script
- **Behavior**: Only seeds empty databases, preserves data between deployments
- **Manual Control**: `npm run seed:reset` for complete database reset

#### Frontend API Connectivity Fix
- **Problem**: Frontend using `http://localhost:3001/api` (local machine) instead of production API
- **Root Cause**: Vite environment variables are embedded at build time, not runtime
- **Solution**: Changed fallback API URL from absolute to relative path
- **File Modified**: `frontend/src/services/api.ts`
- **Change**: `API_BASE_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL || '/api'`
- **Result**: Frontend now uses nginx proxy instead of trying to connect to localhost

#### Database Authentication Resolution
- **Problem**: API containers losing database connection after manual restarts
- **Cause**: Environment variables from GitHub secrets not available during manual container operations
- **Solution**: Triggered proper GitHub Actions deployment to set correct passwords
- **Process**: GitHub Actions injects `DB_PASSWORD` secret into both database and API containers

#### Environment Variable Management
- **Challenge**: Vite requires environment variables at build time
- **Previous Approach**: Setting `VITE_API_URL` in docker-compose (runtime)
- **Corrected Approach**: Use relative paths for production, absolute URLs for development
- **Benefit**: Works regardless of environment variable configuration

### 📋 Deployment Process Refinements

#### Smart Database Seeding Workflow
```bash
# GitHub Actions deployment now includes:
1. Deploy containers with proper environment variables
2. Run database migrations
3. Smart seeding (only if database is empty)
4. Preserve existing user data between deployments
```

#### Manual Database Operations
```bash
# Safe seeding (preserves existing data)
npm run seed

# Complete reset and reseed
npm run seed:reset

# Check database status
docker exec nutritrack-db psql -U nutritrack -d nutrition_db -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ingredients;"
```

### 🔍 Debugging Process Executed

#### API Connectivity Verification

- Tested nginx proxy: `http://78.47.123.191/api/dishes` ✅
- Verified container health and communication ✅

#### Database Connection Validation
- Checked container logs for authentication errors
- Verified database credentials match between containers
- Confirmed data existence: 15 ingredients, 5 dishes ✅

#### Frontend Configuration Analysis

3. **Environment Configuration**: Resolved Vite build-time variable issues
4. **Container Orchestration**: Proper secret management through GitHub Actions
5. **Full Stack Integration**: End-to-end connectivity from frontend to database

### 🚀 Production URLs (Verified Working)
- **Frontend Application**: http://78.47.123.191
- **API Endpoints**: http://78.47.123.191/api/* (via nginx proxy)
- **Direct API**: http://78.47.123.191:3001/api/* (direct access)
